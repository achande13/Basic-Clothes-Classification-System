# Basic-Clothes-Classification-System
This is a the most basic Neural network application using Keras and Tensorflow,  that too without using convolutions and Pooling.
The dataset used is fasion_MNIST which are zolando's article images. The whole dataset is given by fashion mnist project.
They are all single byte grey scale images.
